Nowadays, more and more cars have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay available, which allow users to be so-called “connected” to the world while driving by having their mobile phone read any messages, emails, etc. through the car’s speakers. One of the ways is to check the latest news from around the world.  However, doing so on their phone while driving can put themselves and others at risk, making it important to be able to read the latest news with minimal distraction.

My application meets this requirement, as the user can listen to the news articles of the selected category based on their current interest as if they wanted to play a song, thus allowing them to perform their actions in an environment known to the user.  To distract the driver as little as possible, my app reads the headlines of news the news articles from the selected category.

The application is not yet complete.  Other feasible elements can be: voice-based search of all news articles, displaying the latest news from any category, and the use of other languages ​​in addition to English.
